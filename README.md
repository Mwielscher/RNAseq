## About this Repository  
This is collection of scripts to analyse RNA sequencing data from start (FASTQ or unaligned BAM file) to end (differential gene expression, heatmap, enrichment analysis). Large chunks of code are adopted from [limma tutorial](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/html/RNAseq123.html)
